## Bayesian Stats

This page consists of my final project on Bayesian stats. THe code and report is in a private repo and can be shared upon request. 


Bayesian statistics has been utilized to quantify uncertainties to fatigue life estimation. 
Mechanical fatigue is a well-known phenomenon which occurs when a load carrying 
member is subjected to a cyclic loading for a given amount of time (cycles). Fatigue life 
estimation comes with inherent variability due to uncertainty in variables affecting it. 
Fatigue life can be estimated using stress vs cycles (SN fatigue) or strain vs cycles (EN 
fatigue). The report uses EN fatigue, but the approach can be translated into SN fatigue as 
well. <br>

The report closely follows this paper <br>
 “Pattabhiraman, S., and Kim, N., "Bayesian Technique for Reducing Uncertainty in 
Fatigue Failure Model," SAE Technical Paper 2009-01-0560,
